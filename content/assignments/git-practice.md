title: Git Practice

Explore resources, work through the 'introducing git' project, then review terms and further resources.

## Part 0 - In Class Lecture
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you do not have one.
- Optionally, [verify your student status](https://github.com/edu/students) for some perks.

## Part 1 - Understand the Jargon & Concepts
- Wow, the [git glossary](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary) is full of gibberish, huh. Bookmark this page, and refer to it when terms appear later.
- Read this [technical overview](https://www.cduan.com/technical/git/).
- Review [How Git Works in 4 Minutes Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lnsKot_SQ)

## Part 2 - 'Introduction to GitHub' Project
- Instructions are on [this page](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
- Follow along with the 'course', creating a new repository.
