## Prototype a novel interaction in Unity

Work in teams. 

The interaction must do one of the following stated objectives, picking one from column A and one from column B

| User Objective     | System Constraint                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Select from a list | Using their entire body                      | 
| Pick a color       | Without vision                               | 
| Enter a Number     | Without hands                                |
| Unlock a Door      | Collaboratively                              |
| Remove a word from a sentence | Accidentally, while doing something else     |
| Choose a hairstyle | While role-playing a scene                   | 
| Roll a die | Without someone they are talking to noticing |
