title: Investigate Priors Paper
---
Analyze an existing modeling-for-XR tool, research project, interface, or software.

Every student will be given a different tool to explore.
Write a 1-2 page paper that investigates what the tool is, and what we can learn from it.
The paper should generally aim to answer the following prompts, or in the same spirit.
The given prompts are just to get you in the right direction on what to write. They are not the rubric.


## Investigation Prompts
Generally speaking, your paper has three main objectives: What is it? What Did it do that was interesting? What can we learn from it? (positive or negative lessons)

- What is it?
- When was it made? What was the context in which it was made? What other tools existed at the time?
- Why did the authors claim to make it?
- Why do you think they made it?
- What hardware interface does it use?
- What was the authors principal question?
- Did it work?
- Is it any good?
- What inspirations did the thing have?
- What did the thing inspire? It's legacy?
- How does it model a shape? (users mental model)
- What are the barriers to trying it (at the time/best case deployment)
- What did the authors miss?
- What failed about it?
- What succeeded about it?
- What should we steal from it?
- What's the most interesting user moment? User story? User profile/demographic?
- What would a modern version of it look like?
- What would an at-scale version of it look like?
- Who cares? Why do they care?
- Is it weird?
