## Assignment

Every day, write down 1 postive annd 1 negative UX "thing" that you noticed. Include a photo or screenshot if you can
We will do this for the first 3 weeks of the class, sharing our "things" every friday.


## Examples

### Positive
- I start a podcast on my phone, thenn shove my phone into my bag. Later, I need to pause it. I do this from my watch, and it just works.
- My car's cupholder is situated that I never need to look down to grab it and grab a drink
- When I tie my shoes, and I pull on the end of the laces and they all tighten evenly; it is visually satisfying.

### Negative
- Sometimes when I play or pause on spotify, the button updates and it looks like it is playing, but the music does not start. I stare dumbly at the device telling me it's playing, as it connects to the network, and I start checking my speakers.
- I do not know when to get to the movie theater before a movie. I do not know whenn the movie will start, and I want to use the restroom as late as possibe, because the movie is long. Do I go now and miss the start, or will another trailer play? Has the movie started yet?
- Every time I switch from my code editor to my IDE, it has to recompile. It takes a long time, and I have to do it before entering play mode.
- I do not remember which side of the theater my assigned seat is closer towards, so I only guess at which side will disrupt the fewest people.
- I do not have a convenient way to save where in a PDF I was. Wherever I start reading, I have to continue reading on that device.
